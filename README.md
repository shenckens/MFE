This is the repo for my MSc AI Thesis on Monocular Floor Plan Estimation.


### For now

- Study NeuralRecon method and code

Bring together:

- [ ] Model Reconstruction (get the baseline to work)
- [ ] Layout Detection (room corners/manhatten/cuboid assumptions)
- [ ] Semantic Segmentation (doors, windows, others)

If all three boxes ticked:
- [ ] Fuse into a working floorplan estimation model

### For later
- Find improvements



<!-- TODO LIST:
- [ ] Keyframes from series of images
- [ ] Room Layout Model for a single image
- [ ] Depth Estimation Model (various image resolutions)
- [ ] Assign positions to RGB pixels
- [ ] 2D Wall Segmentation / Object Filtering
- [ ] Point-cloud / Voxelation
- [ ] Camera Pose Estimation
- [ ] Global axes image aggregation
- [ ] Top-view Floor Plan Generation
- [ ] MAKE IT MOBILE! (PyTorch Mobile iOS app) -->
